# Pass Notes - Gamified

Ever try giving advice to a teenager? It's nearly impossible.

Why?

Teenagers are programmed to think that anything adults do is "not cool".

That's why I build a cool website. Teens can hate the advice, but will love the mini games.
If this site was a trope, it would be enemies to lovers.

Make with [v0](v0.app).
